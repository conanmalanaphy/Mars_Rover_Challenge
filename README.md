# Mars_Rover_Challenge

The project reads a CSV file held in the pubic folder called rover_instructions.csv

In the project directory, you can run:

**yarn install** </br>
Runs the package manager to get all of the node modules

**yarn start** </br>
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**yarn test** </br>
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. 

**What I would have done differently if i had more time**
1. Better UI - currently very basic grid, i would have liked it to take up the who screen height and visually be more appealing. 
2. The CSV loader could have been done with a drag and drop loader.
3. On the fly add a new rover in the UI with input boxes
